# Email Sorter Backend

A FastAPI-based backend service that helps users automatically organize their Gmail accounts using AI-powered email categorization.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **FastAPI Application**: RESTful API service handling authentication, Gmail account management, and email categorization
- **Background Worker**: Periodic email sync process running alongside the main application
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores user data, Gmail accounts, emails, and categories
- **OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered email classification using GPT models

### Key Features

#### Multi-Account Management
- Users can connect one primary Gmail account for authentication
- Additional Gmail accounts can be connected for email management
- Each account maintains its own OAuth2 credentials and sync status

#### Email Synchronization
- Background worker polls Gmail accounts every minute for new emails
- Emails are downloaded, processed, and categorized automatically
- Sync status and timestamps are maintained per account

#### AI-Powered Classification
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze email content
- Automatically categorizes emails based on their content and context
- Intelligent summarization of email content for better organization
- Adapts to user-defined categories for personalized sorting

#### Authentication & Security
- Google OAuth2 for both authentication and Gmail API access
- JWT-based session management
- Separate OAuth2 flows for primary (auth) and secondary (connect) accounts

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Project with Gmail API enabled
- Google OAuth2 credentials
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/google/callback
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the application (development)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## üìê API Design

### Key Endpoints

- `/api/v1/auth/*`: Authentication and OAuth2 flows
- `/api/v1/gmail-accounts/*`: Gmail account management
- `/api/v1/emails/*`: Email operations and categorization
- `/api/v1/categories/*`: Category management

## üîÑ Sync Process

1. Worker process runs alongside the main application
2. Every minute, checks each connected Gmail account
3. Fetches new emails using Gmail API
4. Processes emails through OpenAI for classification
5. Categorizes emails based on AI analysis
6. Updates sync status and timestamps

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates Google OAuth2 login
2. Backend receives OAuth2 callback with authorization code
3. Exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
4. Creates user account if new, or updates existing
5. Issues JWT session token

### Account Connection Flow
1. Authenticated user initiates new account connection
2. Similar OAuth2 flow but stores as secondary account
3. Immediate sync triggered for new account
4. Account appears in user's account list

### Email Classification Flow
1. New emails are fetched from Gmail API
2. Email content is preprocessed and sanitized
3. OpenAI API analyzes email content and context
4. AI model determines most appropriate category
5. Email is tagged and stored with classification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Polling-based sync (1-minute intervals)
- Sequential email processing
- Rate limits based on Gmail API quotas

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Replace polling with Gmail Push Notifications
   - Implement WebSocket/SSE for frontend updates
   - Pub/Sub system for scalable event handling

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel email processing
   - Batch API requests
   - Caching frequently accessed data

3. **Scalability**
   - Separate worker processes per account
   - Queue-based email processing
   - Horizontal scaling of workers

## üìö Dependencies

- FastAPI: Web framework
- SQLAlchemy: ORM
- Alembic: Database migrations
- Google API Client: Gmail API integration
- OpenAI: Email classification
- PyJWT: JWT token handling
- Pydantic: Data validation
- uvicorn: ASGI server

## üöÄ Deployment

Currently deployed on Render.com with:
- Web service running both API and worker
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables for configuration
- Automatic deployments from main branch

## üëã Hey There!

This is my backend implementation for the paid challenge! I've built it using FastAPI and deployed it on Render's free tier. Quick heads up - since it's on the free tier, the first request might take a few seconds as the service spins up from its sleep state. But once it's warmed up, everything runs smoothly!
